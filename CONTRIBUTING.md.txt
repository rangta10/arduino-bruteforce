### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue with:

1. **Clear title** describing the problem
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Expected behavior** vs actual behavior
4. **Environment details** (OS, Python version, Arduino board)
5. **Screenshots** if applicable

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome ideas for:

- Additional security demonstrations
- Improved documentation
- Better user experience
- Performance optimizations
- Educational content improvements

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. **Make your changes** with clear commits
4. **Test thoroughly** on your system
5. **Update documentation** if needed
6. **Submit pull request** with detailed description

### Code Standards

**Python Code:**
```python
# Use clear variable names
# Add comments for complex logic
# Follow PEP 8 style guide
# Include error handling

def example_function(param):
    """
    Clear docstring explaining function purpose.
    
    Args:
        param: Description of parameter
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
    """
    try:
        # Implementation
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return None
```

**Arduino Code:**
```cpp
// Use clear comments
// Keep functions modular
// Handle edge cases

/*
  Function description
*/
void exampleFunction(int param) {
    // Implementation
}
```

**Documentation:**
- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples where helpful
- Update README.md if adding features
- Add screenshots for visual features
